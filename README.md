# Employee Attrition Prediction - Capstone Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes HR data from **Salifort Motors** to build a **predictive model** that identifies employees likely to leave the company. Understanding key factors influencing attrition helps the HR department implement **data-driven strategies** to improve employee retention and satisfaction.

## 🎯 Objectives
- 📊 **Analyze** employee data to uncover patterns related to attrition.
- 🤖 **Build** a machine learning model to predict employee turnover.
- 🔍 **Identify** key factors contributing to employee departures.
- 💡 **Provide** actionable insights and recommendations to HR.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains various employee attributes, including:
- 👥 **Demographic details** (age, gender, etc.)
- 💼 **Job-related factors** (salary, department, years at company, etc.)
- 🏢 **Work environment factors** (work-life balance, job satisfaction, etc.)
- 📈 **Performance metrics**

## 🛠️ Methodology
### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handle **missing values** and **outliers**.
- Encode **categorical variables**.
- Normalize **numerical features**.

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identify **trends** and **correlations** between features.
- Visualize **employee satisfaction** and **attrition patterns**.

### 3️⃣ Model Building & Evaluation
- Train multiple **classification models**: `Logistic Regression`, `Random Forest`, `XGBoost`, etc.
- Evaluate models using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.

### 4️⃣ Insights & Recommendations
- Identify **high-risk employee groups**.
- Suggest **HR policies** to improve retention.

## 📊 Results
- **Model Accuracy**: Achieved an accuracy of `X%` in predicting employee attrition.
- **Key Factors**: Work-life balance, salary satisfaction, and career growth opportunities were identified as major drivers of employee turnover.
- **HR Strategies**: Suggested enhancements such as **career development programs** and **improved workplace culture**.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used
- 🐍 **Python** (`Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`)
- 📓 **Jupyter Notebook**
- 📊 **Data Visualization** (`Tableau`, `Power BI`)
